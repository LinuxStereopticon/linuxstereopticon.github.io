Stereopticon is an effort to bring graphical Linux apps to macOS.
This is realized through virtualization, the use of fast mechanisms for sharing window contents between and an integrated approach to providing a flexible GNU/Linux distribution.

Technologies that comprise Stereopticon:
- QEMU for virtualization
- The Stereopticon window painter running on macOS
- A Linux kernel module to share DMA-BUFs over IVSHMEM
- Mir as a Linux Wayland display server
- An inofficial blend of Ubuntu tailored for the use-case
- Snap & Flatpak for packaging support
